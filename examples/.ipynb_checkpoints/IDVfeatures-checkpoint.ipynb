    "> #### 2. Clarify with headings, like `# Head1 and ## Head2`.  [(More on markdown tags)](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics).  Shift+enter to see it rendered.\n",
    "> #### 3. showIdv() will launch an IDV instance. Interact with the GUI directly, as usual. \n",
    "> #### 4. `getImage()` in a code cell will screen capture the IDV view window. \n",
    "> #### 5. Latex equations can be included. For example `$\\frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}$` shows as $ \\frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)} $.\n",
    "> #### 6. A external image can be imported by prefix `%Image path/to/image`\n",
    "> #### 7. A external Youtube video can be inserted by using `%YouTube web/link/to/youtube`\n",
    "> #### 8. Export as .html to a Web server, or .ipynb can be browser-rendered directly on github. "
